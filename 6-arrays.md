## Arrays

1. Write a function that accepts a single Array of Strings as an argument. The function will create a new Array with all the Strings from the original Array converted to uppercase. Then the function
   returns the new Array.
2. Write a function that accepts an Array of numbers and sorts them numerically in ascending order. Remember to pass your custom sort function to the built-in Array sort method. Eg:
   `[1, 8, 81, 18, 4]` would become `[1, 4, 8, 18, 81]`.
3. Write a function that accepts an Array and will move the first value in the Array to the last position in the Array. The function returns the updated Array. You can use the `shift` and `push`
   methods or the spread operator and destructuring to achieve this.
4. Write a function that accepts an Array of names. The function will use the `filter()` method to remove any String that is longer than 5 characters. Then use the `map()` method to convert every name
   to uppercase, and then the `sort` method to sort the remaining uppercase Strings alphabetically. The function returns the new filtered, mapped, and sorted array.
