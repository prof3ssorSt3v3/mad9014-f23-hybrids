# Strings

1. Write a function that accepts a `String` as an argument and `return`s a new String where any spaces have been replaced with an underscore \_. Eg: `function swapSpace(){ }`.
2. Write a function that accepts a `String` as an argument and `return`s the first word from the String in lowercase. Use the `split` method to divide the sentence into words. Eg: If
   `Hello my name is Jeffrey Lebowski` is sent to the function `hello` would be returned.
3. Write a function that accepts a `Number` as an argument, converts the `Number` to a `String`, and then uses the `padStart()` method to make sure that the String is at least 20 characters long. The
   filler text is the number zero.
4. Write a function that accepts a String as an argument. It then uses the `includes()` method to determine if the String contains an `@` sign. If it does, then use the `indexOf` method to determine
   the position in the String of the `@` sign. The function will return `false` if there is no `@` sign or the position integer if one does exist.
