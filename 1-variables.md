# Variables and Data Types

1. Declare five **meaningfully named** variables using `let`. Then assign values to the variables as needed so that there is one of each type: `Boolean`, `String`, `Number`, `undefined`, and `null`.
2. Declare four **meaningfully named** variables with `const`. Assign primitive values to two of them and any kind of Objects to the other two.
3. Copy the following code snippet that declares two variables with values and one without. Add the code that would let you **swap** the values inside the two variables. After your code runs the value
   in `first` should be 42 and the value in `second` should be 7. You need to do this without writing the numbers 7 or 42 in your additional code and without using any functions. Use the other
   variable to temporarily hold one of the values while swapping. No functions need to be used to do this. You are just rearranging the values by assigning them between variables.

```js
let first = 7;
let second = 42;
let temp;
```

4. What are all 9 of the different possible values (datatypes) returned by the `typeof` operator?
